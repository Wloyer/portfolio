As part of an agile and dynamic team, I had the distinct pleasure of developing the VTCSN website, an innovative platform aimed at supporting young entrepreneurs venturing into the ride-hailing service industry. Our mission was to cultivate a professional yet user-friendly digital environment, and we started with designing a unique, identifiable logo that symbolizes the heart of the client's vision. 

Although we had a template as a starting point, we collectively made a decision to rebuild the website with a focus on responsive design and maintainability. Our tech stack included HTML, CSS ,Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, Symfony and we made extensive use of MySQL for database management.

In terms of functionality, we implemented a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system and a secure sign-in procedure that includes email verification for new accounts. We prioritized security throughout the development process, including URL protection and password hashing, to ensure a safe online space for our users.

One of the key highlights of this project is its scalability, designed to cater to a multi-country audience, thus reflecting the global aspirations of the entrepreneurs we are assisting. The client, a benevolent association supporting young entrepreneurs with limited IT skills, praised our team's dedication and the high quality of our work. The VTCSN project embodies my commitment to aiding nascent businesses and my capacity to deliver technologically adept and secure solutions in a collaborative setting.
