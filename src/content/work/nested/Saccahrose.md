I'm thrilled to present "Saccahrose," an e-commerce platform dedicated to selling authentic French pastries. This project holds a special place in my heart, as it is the first full-fledged website I've developed. Created during my Brevet de technicien sup√©rieur (BTS), it served as a comprehensive platform to apply and showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Symfony.

The primary objective of "Saccahrose" was to create a user-friendly and secure platform where customers could explore and purchase a wide range of delicious French pastries. I incorporated HTML and CSS to establish the structure and design of the website. By using a combination of these languages, I ensured the website was visually appealing, responsive, and easy to navigate.

JavaScript played a crucial role in enhancing the interactivity of the website. It was used for form validation, handling user inputs, and creating dynamic content like sliders and modal windows, enhancing the overall user experience.

For the backend, I opted for Symfony, a powerful PHP framework. With Symfony, I was able to manage the website's functionalities effectively. Symfony's strong security features were beneficial for implementing user authentication and data protection. Users can register themselves on the website and have their email addresses verified before they can proceed .

One key feature of "Saccahrose" that I'm particularly proud of is the handcrafted CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) bundle. It was a challenging yet rewarding process to build this feature from scratch. This bundle allows administrators to manage the website's products, orders, and user profiles seamlessly.

From conceptualizing the platform to writing the final line of code, working on "Saccahrose" was a rewarding journey. It was an incredible opportunity to transform theoretical knowledge into practical, working code and to create an application that serves real-world needs.

I invite you to explore "Saccahrose," sign up for an account, and experience first-hand the features and functionalities that make it unique. Any feedback or inquiries about this project are always welcome and appreciated.
